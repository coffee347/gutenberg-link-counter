# gutenberg-link-counter
## This plugin counts the links and block the editing if the total amount of them is less than 5.
Just activate it and edit any post or page in Gutenberg. You'll notice a new string on the upper right side. If everything's okay (requirements are met), here's what you'll see.

Otherwise, the update button will be blocked until sufficient number of hyperlinks will be added.

The plugin doesn't block autosaving of the draft copies and works directly with the DOM without any real integration.
